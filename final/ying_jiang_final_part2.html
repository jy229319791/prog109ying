</head>
<body>
  <h1>•	What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h1>
  <h2>I had no experience about HTML/CSS/Javascript before, so this course was brand-new to me. I only took a couple of courses about Java language.</h2>
  <h1>•	Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h1>
  <h2>Yes, I did use a template. It helped me with the portfolio’s structure, and I styled it and made some creative parts.</h2>
  <h1>•	What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</h1>
  <h2>The most challenging part for me is to decide what the template should be use, and how to scratch it. Besides, all pages that use the same CSS also took me most of time. </h2>
  <h1>•	How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </h1>
  <h2>The knowledge that I gained in this class inspired and was impressive me a lot. I learned how to make a simple website, what the website is made of, how a website to be build up. I appreciated the popularity of the web world. The web development brings a lot of convenience to this world. </h2>
  <h1>•	What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h1>
  <h2>Taking enough time every week to study and review the knowledge during the week. It’s very important to consolidate the knowledge about HTML, and CSS in the beginning. If you feel fall behind, ask questions or watch the video about the content you’re struggling with. Javascript could be the tough part in this course, so please remember to take more time on it ! </h2>
